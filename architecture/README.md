# Architecture Design for "Innovate Inc."

> **Note**: This is a placeholder for the architecture design task. Complete this after finishing the technical Terraform task.

## Assignment Requirements

Design a cloud infrastructure architecture for "Innovate Inc." that addresses:

### 1. Cloud Environment Structure
- Recommend optimal number of AWS accounts/GCP projects
- Justify choices for isolation, billing, and management

### 2. Network Design
- VPC architecture
- Network security measures

### 3. Compute Platform
- Kubernetes service deployment strategy
- Node groups, scaling, resource allocation
- Containerization strategy (image building, registry, deployment)

### 4. Database
- PostgreSQL service recommendation
- Backup, high availability, disaster recovery strategy

### 5. Application Details
- **Backend**: Python/Flask
- **Frontend**: React (SPA)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Traffic**: Low initially (hundreds/day) → millions of users
- **Data**: Sensitive user data (strong security required)
- **Deployment**: CI/CD focused

## Deliverables

1. **README.md** (this file) - Main architecture document
2. **High-Level Diagram (HDL)** - Visual representation of the architecture
3. **Detailed explanations** for each component
